Chapter 2.1 do-release-upgrade
==============================

Do release upgrade is the command line tool for upgrading lubuntu releases. To run it you need root privledges which from the command line means typing sudo in front to run as root. Upgrades to a new operating system version can sometimes cause problems so please backup all your files beforehand and you should be backing up your files anyway to not lose them. The command you need to enter is sudo do-release-upgrade on the command line this checks if a new version is released  and will upgrade. This will upgrade a lot of packages so plugging in your laptop is strongly recommended.
