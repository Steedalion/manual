Appendix C command line
=======================

The command line is a different way of interfaceing with your computer that while not nesecary to learn can be helpful if you take the time to learn it.

One important way to learn about the command line of each command that can be used in Lubuntu is a bit beyond the scope of the manual but to learn more about a command and all of its options run the following fi you wanted to learn more about the df or disk free command 

.. code::
   
   man df

will show you info and explanation of the df command. One really useful option shown is for example is the -h for human readable output. so runing 

.. code::
  
   df -h 

will make a much nicer output than 

.. code:: 
   
   df
