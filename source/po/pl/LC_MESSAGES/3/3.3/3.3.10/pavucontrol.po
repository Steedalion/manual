"PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) is a simple GTK+ based volume "
"control tool (mixer) for the PulseAudio sound server. In contrast to "
"classic mixer tools this one allows you to control both the volume of "
"hardware devices and of each playback stream separately. It also allows "
"you to redirect a playback stream to another output device without "
"interrupting playback"
