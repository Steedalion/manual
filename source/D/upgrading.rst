Appendix D Upgrading from previous releases
===========================================

Do release upgrade is the command line tool for upgrading lubuntu releases. To run it you need root privledges which from the command line means typing sudo in front to run as root. Upgrades to a new operating system version can sometimes cause problems so please backup all your files beforehand and you should be backing up your files anyway to not lose them. The command you need to enter is sudo do-release-upgrade on the command line this checks if a new version is released  and will upgrade. This will upgrade a lot of packages so plugging in your laptop is strongly recommended.  

Since Lubuntu 18.10 switches to LXQt from the previous LXDE releases so this upgrade is more complicated. This process will need to remove some of the old LXDE process to not have a cluttered and incosistent system. Since Lubuntu 18.04 was a long term support release in software and updates which you can launch from the menu in Lubuntu 18.04 by menu -> Prefrences -> Software & Updates. Then on the updates tab notify me of a new ubuntu version and select for any new version and enter your password to authenticate this choice. The GUI will give you a notice of a new release or from the command line you can run `sudo do-release-upgrade`. This gives a warning that this may take several hours and install many new packages so make sure you have time to finish this as you can break your install if you do not finish the install.
